  <!-- 
    The `<wbr>` tag in HTML stands for **Word Break Opportunity**.
     It is used to specify a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, even if its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.
     This tag is particularly useful when you want to add word break opportunities in long words that might be broken at the wrong place by the browser.
     Here's an example of how you can use the `<wbr>` tag in HTML:
          
          <p>
            To learn AJAX, you must be familiar with the XML<wbr>Http<wbr>Request Object.
          </p>

This will allow the browser to break the word "XMLHttpRequest" at any of the `<wbr>` tags, if necessary.

You can experiment with this tag using the [W3Schools Tryit Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_wbr).

  <!-- 
    The `<bdi>` tag in HTML stands for **Bi-Directional Isolation**. 
      It is used to isolate a part of text that might be formatted in a different direction from other text outside it.
      This element is particularly useful when embedding user-generated content with an unknown text direction.
      For example, you can use the `<bdi>` tag to isolate usernames from the surrounding text-direction settings:
          
          <ul>
            <li> User <bdi> hrefs </bdi>: 60 points </li>
            <li> User <bdi> jdoe </bdi>: 80 points </li>
            <li> User <bdi> إيان </bdi>: 90 points </li>
          </ul>

The `<bdi>` tag is supported by most modern browsers. You can find more information about this tag on the [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_bdi.asp).

Additionally, you can refer to the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdi) and [Envato Tuts+](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/html-element-bdi--cms-107055a) for more details about the `<bdi>` tag.
